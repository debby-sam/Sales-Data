Project Title: Customer Sales Analytics – A Decade of Dirty

Data Objectives: 
• Clean and preprocess a dirty dataset with more than 50,000 rows and 20 columns. 
• Understand and categorize 6+ categorical variables (e.g., Gender, Category, 
Payment Mode, etc.). 
• Identify and fix issues such as inconsistent formats, missing values, outliers, and data 
entry errors. 
• Create useful insights using grouping, aggregation, filtering, and merging techniques. 
• Build compelling visualizations to tell stories hidden in the data.Dataset Summary: 
Your dataset (Customer_Sales_Data_Dirty.csv) includes: 
• 10+ years of sales data 
• Over 50,000 transactions 
• 6+ categorical variables (Customer Gender, Product Category, Sub-Category, Payment 
Mode, Store Location, Delivery Status) 
• Numerical fields like Age, Quantity, Price_per_Unit, and Total_Amount 
• Inconsistencies such as: 
o Mixed date formats 
o Misspelled or inconsistent categorical values 
o Missing or zero values in key columns 
o Typos in email addresses 
o Outliers in Age and Ratings

Tasks: 
1. Data Exploration & Cleaning: 
o Inspect the structure and summary statistics of the dataset. 
o Identify and clean inconsistencies (e.g., gender entries like "F", "female", 
"FEMALE", etc.). 
o Handle missing values and outliers using appropriate techniques. 
2. Feature Engineering: 
o Extract the year from the transaction date for time-based analysis. 
o Create a new field for sales revenue per transaction. 
o Group similar values where necessary (e.g., normalize "Cash", "CASH", and 
"cash" into one). 
3. Analysis: 
o What are the most and least popular product categories over the years? 
o Which store location had the highest revenue? 
o Is there a correlation between product returns and customer ratings? 
o How does customer age relate to purchasing trends? 
4. Visualization: 
o Trend of total sales over the years. 
o Bar chart of top 5 product categories by quantity sold. 
o Pie chart or horizontal bar of gender distribution. 
o Heatmap showing the correlation between numeric fields.
